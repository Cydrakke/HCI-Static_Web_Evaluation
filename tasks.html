                            <li>Security vulnerabilities and inconsistent input Sanitation pose as a threat, but sql injection were blocked on a login page.</li>
                            <li>The overall UI and the display content need an improvement and optimize sizes of content like banner. There is a performance issue during product sorting and searches that may affect user satisfaction.</li>

                            Overall, the evaluation revealed that the system is mostly functional and enables user to complete
                            key tasks, there are significant usability and security concerns. The system's major strengths lie
                            in its core task functionality and stable payment integration, but weaknesses include poor input Sanitation,
                            lack of user feedback mechanisms, and missing features like order tracking and undo capabilities.Solving These
                            issues will surely enhance both security and user experience of the system.
